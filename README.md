### Install Instructions

`git clone` the repository. If `git` is not installed, type `sudo apt-get install git` and provide a password when requested.

`git clone git://github.com/Blockchain-Expiriment/Blockchain-Expiriment`

Run `install.sh` to confirm all required files are loaded.

If you do not have `node`, install it similarly to `git`: `sudo apt-get install node`    
This should include NPM (a package manager).

Run the appropriate shell file (`install.cmd` for Windows, `install.sh` for Mac).
